I like to capture poignant and profound moments with a creative twist. I offer exceptional professional and personal service for each and every one of my clients, so get in touch today and book your session of a photoshoot.<p>

I started taking pictures of my passion, my thoughts, and curious wonderings about our world. I found and created <a class="igaa" href="https://www.instagram.com/ahmedaga__/" target="_blank">@ahmedaga__</a> with a mission to give others a taste of what goes on in my mind, and I have been at it ever since.

                      <p id="about-p">With an interest in technology and art, photography soon became a passion for me, a devoted and underrated Portrait Photographer. I began by shooting photos of family members, friends, and nature, and soon developed my own personal style. I decided to take photography seriously and build a career of it in 2019 and it was the easiest and the best choice I have ever made, and i never looked back. I use some of the best equipment available and hold pre-shot consultations with clients to get a better understanding of their vision and preferences.

                    <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                    <li>I have liked taking close up pictures of people for the longest time, so the answer is that i like taking portrait photography the most.&nbsp;I also like taking nature pictures, but that's not really my type of photography.</li>

             <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Coding And Programming :</i></h1>
             <ol>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you remember so many commands and shortcuts?</li>
                <ul>
                    <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                    <li>It's really not that hard, when you code/program every day for 30min for at least a week you remeber it very easily. And you can google all of the keyboard shortcuts and once you start using them constatly you remember them too, very easily.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you write so much lines so quick?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>When you're using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> like me to program it has a lot of shortcuts, and it's a lot easier to code in Visual Studio Code. It also finishes sentences, elements, symbols and many more for you. I also have many plugins to make my coding/programming experience a lot better and easier.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which programs do you use to program/code?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>As i mentioned in the answer to question 2. i use Visual Studio Code to code Html, Css And Java Script. But if you don't want to download VSC (Visual Studio Code) you can use programs that are already downloaded to your Computer, like Notepad, Microsoft Word or else.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get bored while coding?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>Yes, and No, I'll explain. When i code for a couple hours, i get bored eventually, but not always. If im coding something that i like or im close to the end of the program i don't get bored, i get motivated to finish. But if i'm coding something that i'm not happy to code, i get bored really quick, but remember, i don't quit.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you good at coding/programming?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I would say not, but that doesn't mean i'm bad. I just got started with coding and programming a couple months ago and i have progressed very much i would say. For a begginer i would say im good, but compared to others i would say i'm bad.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been coding/programming?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>As i mentioned in question 5. i have been coding and programming for a couple months, 3 and a half months to be exact.</li>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you like games so much?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I like games because they relief me, i forget about all my problems and of course i feel happy.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you like more,Discord Or In Game voice chat?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I rather preffer Discord to communicate with friends when playing video games together.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you prefer more, Good Graphics or Good Gameplay?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I preffer Good Gameplay and Realistic Physics before Graphics, but Graphics have to be good too if you want to call a game good or not. Conclusion, one can't go without other.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you like Realistic games or Cartoony games?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I like realistic games more than the cartoony ones, because i feel like im in the game when the game is realistic, but when i play cartoony games i feel like im watching anime or something like that.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one do you like more, RPG games or Battle Royale/Shooting games?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I like Battle Royale/Shooting Games more than RPG(role playing games), because you feel like you're in the game, you need to think every step through and think about every possible thing that can happen before you start doing it.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What game do you like the most?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"

                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>The stunt scooter company i like the most is probably Envy (Blunt).</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your favourite trick?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>My favourite trick that is easy is 100% a barspin, but my favourite hard trick is definetly 360 Full Whip, that's probably my dream trick too.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did you buy your scooter from?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I bought my Scooter from <a href="https://micro-romobil.ba/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAoNWOBhCwARIsAAiHnEj6jMLvYS_yfya3rrCSXelFmpW24aoksPTSGDzwc-qal00eWGcP0w0aAn1yEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Micro BiH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> It's a great Swiss company.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you feel when someone asks to try your scooter?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>If someone i know asks me to take a spin on my scooter i don't think about it at all, i just give it to them. But when someone i don't know asks me to ride my scooter, i don't if i should give it to them, because of course im scared, i think that it's going to get stolen, or even get damaged.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to look after when buying a scooter?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>Of course when buying a scooter you want to do a little search to know what kind of scooters you like. When you do, find some good and trustable company. Then you want to look after quality, size, color and comfort.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you become so good?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>By practice of course, i started riding scooters and didn't have any motivation or i didn't know where to start from. Then i bought a new scooter, started watching youtube tutorials, practiced and never stopped.</li>

                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I like cooking because i used to watch my mom cook when i was a kid, and then started helping her, then i stared cooking alone, and i somehow i found happiness in that. And it doesn't matter that im male, there are a lot of male cooks, in fact the best cook in the world is male.</li>

                <li>Yes i do bake but i'm not very good at it, so i stopped baking because of many fails, i just saw that it wasn't for me.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you like or make Oily Food?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>Yes i like making oily food, beacuse almost every other food is oily, you just cannot avoid it, but i do not preffer it beacuse it is unhealthy.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ever get cut on the knife while cutting or burn yourself while cooking?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>Of course i get cut, if you cook or ever cooked you defintely got cut too, it's something that's very hard to avoid. And i get burnt too, most of the times it's on the pan, because i forgot that it's hot, or i actidentally put my hand on it.</li>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been cooking?</li>
                <p style="color:rgb(156, 115, 101)"
                <li>I have been cooking since i have been a kid, and never stopped, it was always in my heart. And all in common i have probably been cooking for like 5-6 years. But i haven't been cooking alone all the time, sometimes it was with my mom.</li>
